# Unity Primitives

The most common Unity primitives can be used and serialized by the serializer. These types include
`AnimationCurve`, `Bounds`, `BoundsInt`, `Color32`, `Color`, `GradientAlphaKey`, `GradientColorKey`, `GradientFormatter`, 
`Keyframe`, `LayerMask`, `Matrix4x4`, `Quaternion`, `RangeInt`, `Rect`, `RectInt`, `RectOffset`, `Vector2`, `Vector2Int`, 
`Vector3`, `Vector3Int`, `Vector4`, `Vector4Int`, and `WrapMode`

It also supports all these types as an array (for example `Color[]`), as lists (for example `List<Color>`), and as nullable 
(for example `Color?`).
