# Quick Start

The easiest way to get started with ALE right now is to important the 'Completed Scene' sample and modify that. 
Unfortunately, there's no simple way to set up ALE from scratch right now, so this will be the best way for now.

1. Navigate to the package manager: Window â†’ Package Manager.
2. Make sure you're looking at the packages in your project. 
3. Click on 'Advanced Level Editor' under 'Hertzole'.
4. Under 'Samples', click 'Import' on the 'Completed Scene' sample.

Unity should now import a working sample for you to build upon and learn from.
